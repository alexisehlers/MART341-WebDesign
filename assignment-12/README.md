## Week 12 Response
1. What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

 * Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself, margin is the space between the box/element and other elements or the edge of the parent element, and borders create boundaries around the element itself.

2. Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.

* A challenge I had was with the floating portion of the assignment, I wasn't sure position it but with a little experimentation I was able to figure it out.
