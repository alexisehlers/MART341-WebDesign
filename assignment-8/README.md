## Week 8 Response

1. A div is an block element which is used to create CSS based layouts in HTML, while a span is an inline element used to style text. The id attribute gives something a unique name to refer to when styling your webpages, and allows you to edit it individually. Similar to the id element, the class attribute gives HTML elements a special identifier. The difference is that it groups similar HTML elements together.

2. So the advantages of using a website like YouTube to host your videos is that it doesn't slow down your webpage, you don't have to store it or maintain the video which could cost extra money with the greater the storage needed to host the video. The downfall could be the external website crashing or the removal of the video.

3. The challenges I had this week were understanding how to format my index.html document, I'm still learning how to indent the elements and tags in a way that doesn't make them into a code block. I overcame the challenge by just experimenting with different things, it's still not perfect but maybe with a little research I can have it figured out by the next assignment.
