## Week 11 Response
1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

* System fonts are already installed on your device, they can be used in most programs but not usually on the web. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. Web-safe fonts are fonts that developers can count on being available by the system.

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

* It's important because if your main font fails to load then your secondary one will hopefully work and display on your webpage.

3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.

* I was a little confused on using self vs. library-hosted fonts so I read up on it with W3 Schools.S
