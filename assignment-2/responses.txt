The internet in the structure that all websites, links and search engines live on. Its what the web was built with, and the web couldn't live without the internet, though the internet could live without the web. I would compare the internet to the mothership of the web, with the web being small pods inside of it that hold different sites and information.
How it works is that the internet is a network of networks, a place where hypertext, web, file sharing, images and other things can live and be transmitted to anywhere with an access point to that network. The DOD first developed it in use for the military to transmit information and training, and it is still used to communicate information and link different networks to share it in a more effective and economic way.
A directory is a folder, a kind of capsule that holds and organizes files. The directories are formed in a hierarchical structure which allows the storing and organization of many different files.
VCS allows collaboration within teammates, with changes being kept track of in a way that allows mistakes to be easily corrected. Another benefit to this is that a previous state of the design can be restored. Something else that is nice with VCS is that in student work, mistakes can be found and fixed without ruining your entire project. The backup is stored so it can be used or referenced to again.
