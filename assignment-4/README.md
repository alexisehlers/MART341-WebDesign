**Week 4 Response**

1. How browsers function is they find, receive, and display different things that are found on the web onto your device. These things could be web pages, images, videos, and so much more. The browsers I use are Microsoft Edge and mainly Chrome.

2. Markup languages process and design text in how it is displayed. These languages can format, layout, and style text for the web. HTML is one of the most popular markup languages and is used a bunch in computer development.

**Discussion**

A question I have this week is how do you edit the names of folders in the Github Browser? This week, a big focus was on HTML and developing. Other topics were browsers, pages, the DOM, and document structures. While it was extremely confusing at first, small steps were helpful in understanding the concepts and taking frequent breaks. I really liked how everything made more sense towards the end of the module, and when I displayed my first website it was a great feeling! Problems I had were recalling the HTML and Markdown concepts, so I needed to review and reference the course website a lot. I think with time that will come more easily though.
