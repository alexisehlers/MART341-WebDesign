This week's lesson was on files and directories, what exactly those are, naming files and directories, developing with GitHub, and different kinds of documentation. I thought that the homework was really straight forward and informative, I feel like I still need to review more and go over all of it though to really let it sink in. In particular, I liked the screenshots that were used to illustrate the tasks given in th homework. I appreciated that and because I am primarily a visual learner, being able to see the lessons in action definitely helped cement those concepts as we got into developing. The challenges I faced really boiled down to time management and getting what I needed to, done. My sucess is that I finally did. Yay!
