        <p> Hello! My name is Lexi Ehlers and I've been blessed grow up in the beautiful state of Montana. I'm based out of Flathead County near Glacier National Park, but love to travel and am always available for a destination wedding. Ever since I can remember I have always loved art, photography, and creating digital images. Currently a senior at the University of Montana, I am studying Media Arts and English. I enjoy incorporating the different lessons I learn in my degree program into my work as an artist. Growing up in a big family, I've learned to multitask and embrace the chaos.  This experience is beneficial when shooting weddings, family sessions, or whatever else is needed.  I work for 406 Woman Magazine doing photography and editing, and have also worked for local Glacier wedding photographer Marianne Weist. Not only am I here to make your day as special as possible, but to collaborate with you in the best way I can to create your vision.  I look forward to hearing from you to discuss my photography packages or other artsy needs!
        </p>

          Sincerely,</p>
