### Week 9 Response

1. **Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?**

* In learning HTML I was a bit intimidated at first, but I feel that everything is starting to gel better and make more sense. Something new was actually having all my code work how I wanted it to without any problems, and the interesting thing that I learned was how to make my pages look nice!

2. **Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?**

* I am exited to see how far I can push styling a webpage, and I want to start applying these techniques in creating my own webpage for a business I'm starting.

3. **Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes.  What did you do to overcome your challenges?**

* A challenge I had with this assignment was being able to carry out the vision I had in my head. I had to learn how to  effectively bring it onto the webpage. To overcome that challenge, I had to research how to accomplish the desired effect, try my best, and if I couldn't figure it out then I had to compromise on what I was trying to do.
