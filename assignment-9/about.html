            <strong>Why did you choose this project?</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>
                      From the time I was young I would always make Challah bread, I learned from a family friend. Whenever I did it was a kind of therapy for me and the process would give me peace. It was also so yummy and everyone loved it!

                  <li>
                      It means that I know I always have something that I can turn to to bring joy to others and ground myself.
